        <h3>Kochi is filled with unexpected wonders that are sure to awaken your inner explorer.</h3>
        <p>An ideal break from European structures and alleyways of Kochi would be Ernakulam, which is its twin city on the mainland. It is a modern bustling city with busy roads, commercial buildings, hotels, shopping malls and much more. An ideal way to
            explore Ernakulam would be to wander through the crowded Broadway or M.G. Road. The very popular Marine Drive and its walkway are one of the best places for an evening stroll. The expansive vistas of the distant Willingdon Island, the setting
            sun and the charming Vembanad Lake form quite an enticing frame. A sunset boat ride meandering through the Vembanad Lake is recommended to sign off the evening. There are a couple of interesting places to visit for history buffs, such has
            Hill Palace and its museum at Tripunithura, Kerala Folklore Museum, and Museum of Kerala History for the enthusiastic history buffs. The art gallery at Durbar Hall is a great place for art lovers as it is very often organises art exhibitions.
            Being a very popular tourist destination, the city has numerous hotels, cafes and popular food joints. Some of the must-visits include Kaikkaâ€™s biryani, Dhe Puttu and Pai Dosas.</p>
